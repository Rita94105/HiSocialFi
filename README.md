## Problems

- real application in web3 and web2

  Although Friend.tech connect Twitter's Accounts, providing only private chatting service.

- user group

  It's difficult to attract new users to use.

- sustainable development

  Like Friend.tech, people think it's a Ponzi scheme, and only can sell and buy shares.

## Solutions

- create Campaign

  Every user can launch campaigns to set assigned tasks for others to achieve in web2 and web3, in order to get the chance of airdrops.

- get profit

  1. People can get airdrops from attending free campaigns, and project parties also can advertise their activities through these platfroms.

  2. People can buy Shares which are combined with Defi-swap pool, getting share profits from the income of transaction fees.

  As a result, more people would like to try and join to web3.

- create private channel

  People can create private channel and sell Shares to others, and others can get some news in this channel and even some profits which depends on projects.

## Implementation

1. Shares

- Adapted based on [FriendtechSharesV1](https://basescan.org/address/0xcf205808ed36593aa40a44f10c7f7c2f67d4a4d4#code) into NFT format allows for trading on third-party markets, enhancing liquidity.

- Publishers can independently configure curve-based parameters, adjusting the pricing curve according to project-specific requirements.

- Users are limited to minting one NFT at a time, and there is no upper limit on the total issuance.

- The concept of "share" can be categorized into two types:
  - Defi-Pool
    People can get share profit from the income of transaction fee.
  - private channel
    People can get news and gifts from the Projects.

2. Campaigns

- Everyone can launch a campaign which should set tasks for users to challenge like following twitter accounts, and use defi-pool to swap, and people will get the chance of airdrop.

3. QQToken

- A platform token designed to reward both event organizers and participants.

- The platform will periodically distribute platform tokens as incentives for user engagement. In future plans, creators of private channels will be required to use QQToken for payment, and additional platform applications will be developed progressively.

4. SimpleSwap

- Special users can create SimpleSwap with pair tokens for users to swap and earn fee profit.

- Each SimpleSwap can match one Share NFT to sell, and owner of Share can share fee profit from the feeReceiver.
